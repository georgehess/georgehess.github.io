<p>I used to think of myself as an artistic fellow. Someone with an inherit knack for the graphic arts. But I was recently humbled by the branding genius of a local Mexican restaurant. I will only go so far &ndash; these amigos however are &ldquo;shaping&rdquo; the future.</p>

<p>One of the Wienerschnitzels, a fast food franchise tailored to hot dog consumers, went out of business in Mount Vernon, WA. Naturally, a drive through Mexican restaurant arose from its ashes. But what does one do with all the left over &ldquo;Wiener&rdquo; stuff? You can&apos;t let it go to waste &ndash; especially during these times of economic crises. Latin&ndash;American ingenuity enter stage left, and presto, transform the giant &ldquo;W&rdquo; into a pair of fighting roosters and reopened as Taqueria El Gallito (loosely translated The Cocky Taco Shop).</p>

<p>So not only do they save on the majority of money it would usually cost to create signage, but they are sublimely capturing the loyal hot dog eating community. Again, genius.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I truly am amazed. Often times in the commercial arts business we are asked to work within limits. Whether it&apos;s due to budget, grandfathered in branding, or the Board of Directors son&apos;s&ndash;nephew&apos;s&ndash;daughter&apos;s favorite color, we are constantly inventing ways to &ldquo;work with what we&apos;ve got&rdquo;. This was truly an amazing feat and I take my sombrero off to you!</p>
