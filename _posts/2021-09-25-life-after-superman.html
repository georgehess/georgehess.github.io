<p>While scrolling through an extensive selection of B movies
	(I don&apos;t have too many hobbies right now), I came across
	<em>Dylan Dog: Dead of Night</em>; a horror movie starring Brandon Routh.
	You might remember Mr. Routh, he played the role of Superman
	in the &apos;06 blockbuster <em>Superman Returns</em>. As I pondered
	this interesting career move, a childhood memory slowly resurfaced.
</p>

<p>I saw a pre&ndash;teen George, perusing the shelves of his local video rental store.</p>

<p class="side-note"><em>Sorry, just a quick side note for the kids: yes children, there were
	once entire businesses centered around the leasing of video tapes and
	charging of nonsensical late fees&hellip; What do you mean &ldquo;what are
	video tapes?&rdquo; Never mind. I digress.</em></p>

<p>Little George looked as though he would be sick! For there was his
	lifelong hero, the Christopher Reeve Superman, on a movie poster for the
	not&ndash;so&ndash;kid&ndash;friendly flick: <em>Village of the Damned</em>.
	I asked my older brother, standing there with me, two questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>How come they were allowed to put a cuss word on a movie poster?</li>
	<li>And why was Superman in it?</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&apos;t remember why he said they were allowed to print the D&ndash;word
	on the poster. Frankly, I was probably the only kid to give a damn. But he answered
	my second question with a question of his own.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>&ldquo;What else can you do after being Superman?&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>At the time, I didn&apos;t fully understand what he meant. But now, with
	Dylan Dog staring me down, it made perfect sense. Superman is arguable one
	of the greatest superheroes of all time. Those are very tough, very red,
	boots to fill. What role would dare follow? Certainly not Dylan Dog. Which
	begs another question; is there life after Superman?</p>

<p>I got all Lois Lane and began my own, and possible the only, investigation
	into the men behind/in front of the cape. And since it was 3PM and I was
	still in my pajamas, I decided to catalogue my findings, for posterity,
	in hopes that the next Last Son of Krypton lands on his feat&hellip;
	again, not a lot of hobbies.</p>

</h2>
<p>First actor to play Superman. Ended his career with this gem:
	<em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086248/" target="_blank">Scalps</a></em>,
	a film about a college student that goes around killing (and presumably
	scalping?) his friends because he&apos;s possessed by an evil
	&ldquo;Indigenous&rdquo; spirit. I&apos;m assuming that some of the dialog
	is, ahem, dated and and if you have an aversion to political incorrectness
	then you should probably skip this one. Actually, everyone should probably
	just skip this one.</p>

	<span class="separator">Christopher Reeve</span>
	<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078346/" target="_blank">Superman (1978)</a>
</h2>
<p>My personal fav, unfortunately superheroed himself right out of a job after
	ushering in world peace and nuclear proliferation in his fourth franchise
	installment. Should he have held out for a fifth? You know what they say,
	damned if you do, <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114852/" target="_blank">Village of the Damned</a></em>
	if you don&apos;t; yet another movie with small towns, aliens, babies,
	freakily little children &ndash; you know the drill.</p>

	<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106057/" target="_blank">Superman (1993)</a>
</h2>
<p>Dean Cane has gone full blown horror. Didn&apos;t think anything could make
	you squirm more than the last season of Lois &amp Clark? Enter
	<em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250613/" target="_blank">New Alcatraz</a></em>
	stage left! The gripping tale of a colossal rouge snake on a mission to take
	over an Arctic prison. I should note that no ginormous serpents were harmed
	in the making of this film.</p>

	<span class="separator">Shaquille O&apos;Neal</span>

</h2>
<p>Steel is as much a Superman flick as Scary Movie is a horror film. But I had
	to mention it. Loosely based, (and I use the term loosely, loosely) on a
	character that once filled in for our beloved Big Blue while Supes was
	laboring through the arduous process of self&ndash;resurrection. Almost
	a decade later Shaq played himself in
	<em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362120/" target="_blank">Scary Movie 4</a></em>.
	It could be argued that Shaq&apos;s acting abilities are so difficult to
	watch that every movie he stars in should be filed away, buried actually,
	under the horror section. Some people might say that, but not me Shaq, and
	certainly never to your face.</p>

<p>More like Super&ndash;boy, really. He explored Superman&apos;s true weakness
	&mdash; peer pressure, in the teen drama <em>Smallville</em>. Chased that
	role with <em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432291/" target="_blank">The Fog</a></em>,
	a horror movie about&hellip; you guessed it, the fog. And not just any fog, Oregon fog!
	But if you ask me, downtown Portland after 10PM is where the real action&apos;s at!</p>

</h2>
<p><em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013860/" target="_blank">Dylan Dog: Dead of Night</a></em>
	is also based on a comic. Just imagine if Dog the Bounty Hunter was from the
	Bayou and instead of searching for perps that skip bail, he tracks werwolves
	and vampires&hellip; Well shoot, this is starting to sound better and better!</p>

<h2>
	<span class="separator">Henry Cavill</span>
	<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/" target="_blank">Superman (2013)</a>
</h2>
<p>Our latest contender debuted his rendition of the Man of Steel with two
	impressively horrific titles already tucked snuggly under his bright yellow
	belt which included the likes of
	<em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354623/" target="_blank">Hellraiser</a></em>
	himself (speaking of movie posters that scared the kraptonite out of
	me as a kid) and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450336/" target="_blank">an occultist Nazi</a>
	(because regular Nazis are soooo overplayed).
</p>
<p>As of this writing, Mr. Cavill is still
	<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12361974/" target="_blank">(re)releasing</a>
	Superman movies and thus, has yet to regress into past transgressions.
	Or has he broken the curse of Krypton? Only time will tell. If I
	could get a single message to Henry it would be this, &ldquo;There is no
	shame in doing Superman for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</p>

	<span class="separator">George Reeves</span>

<p>Now, I know that <span class="strike">a lot</span>
	<span class="strike-above" title="some">^</span>
	<strong><em>one</em></strong> of you is wondering about the greatest of
	them all &mdash; 1950&apos;s Superman George Reeves. He made an entire
	career out of being The Man of Steel. He practically LIVED the role. He even
	quit smoking. In the 50s! And judging by my data he made the
	right choice (for both his career and lungs). But did he ever waiver? Could
	he resist the temptation to explore the darkness within? Well, just before
	his own mysterious death in 1959, it was rumored that Mr. Reeves was looking
	for investors to back a script that he had written and also hoped to star in.
	What kind of script you ask? Sci&ndash;fi baby! And you best believe it would
	have been horrific, both in genre and box office numbers. God rest his soul.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">There you have it. My work here is done. Was it a
	huge waste of time? Perhaps. But I may have just found myself a new hobbie &ndash;
	writing for truth, justice, and the American way!</p>
