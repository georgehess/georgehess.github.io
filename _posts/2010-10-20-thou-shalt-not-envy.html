<p>I have struggled for the longest time to understand why so many women compare themselves to the air&ndash;brushed covergirls that grace our checkout lines and newsstands. To me, it would be like comparing apples to wax oranges. Does&ndash;not&ndash;compute. One is real, one is fake. One tastes nice to kiss, the other like newsprint&hellip; not like I ever tried kissing the Cameron Diaz 1996 edition of Rolling Stone&hellip; wouldn&apos;t know anything about that.</p>

<p>But maybe it does make sense?!</p>

<p>For I found myself in the exact same situation as my female counterparts (minus the sex change). There I was, minding my own business, watching TV, and then he comes on. Oh how I dislike him! But it&apos;s not the pearly white teeth that get to me. Nor the chiseled abs. I could care less about that jawline. It&apos;s the shave! I want it, nay, need it! Oh sure, we all know he&apos;s had a laser remove every last follicle from his face. I&apos;m not stupid. I know there&apos;s not even a blade in there. But as the (faux) razor glides across his adam&apos;s apple without hitting the slightest speed bump I am filled with envy. I want the impossible, I purchase the impossible, and then I attempt the impossible &ndash; a really, really, close shave.</p>

<p>I am optimistic at first. Never mind the prior attempts. Those must have failed due to faulty equipment, this time it will be different. I put my best shave face on. Jaw protruding out for good angles, upper lip filled to 20psi, and I commence to tear my skin apart with a triple stacked blade. The sting is just a reminder of how lazy I&apos;ve become. &ldquo;From now on, I&apos;m going to shave everyday!&rdquo;, I say to myself. How else could I justify spending so much on a device that has been around almost as long as the face.</p>

<p>After a solid 10&ndash;15 minutes of hacking away last week&apos;s 5 o&apos;clock shadow I am ready for inspection. But alas, I look nothing like ol&apos; laser&ndash;razor boy. Instead, I bare an unsettling resemblance to that of a man stricken with the pox. Patchy, bloody, and now plain pissy, I blame genetics and storm off, more determined than ever to grow a beard. I resign to the fact that I am stuck with this face and the only memories of me will be tainted with a sandpaper like texture.</p>

<p>As I slump back down into the recliner a magazine ad catches my eye. &ldquo;More Than Just A Blade&rdquo; &ndash; hmmm, I&apos;m listening&hellip;</p>
