<p>Pepsi&apos;s latest can design is a throw back to the days when life was a little more slow&ndash;paced. It has a nostalgic sort of, &ldquo;remember when&rdquo; look to it. But as for myself, a child born in the early winter of &apos;82, I remember when Pepsi was, well, not as friendly.</p>

<p>I must confess, I cannot take a completely objective approach to the subject of Pepsi Cola. Call it what you will, upbringing, lifestyle, perhaps I was merely born this way, but I am a Coca Cola Classic man. As children, we only had Coca Cola products provided to us (except for a brief period in 1995 when our dear Mother, in an attempt to save money, supplied us with an impostor&hellip; the 25 cent colas). In our house, the villains drank Pepsi and the the heroes drank Coke.</p>

<p>As I grew into my teen years I began experimenting with more exotic sodas &ndash; 7up, Fresca, Dr Pepper, etc. Pepsi released a new can design at that time as well with a very sporty image. Not being the athletic champion I had hoped to blossom into, I shied away from its intimidating demands that I must either push the limits or dance harder than Brittany Spears if I were to taste this caffeinated elixir. I ran.</p>

<p>There was a short duration of time when I succumb to peer pressure and drank copious amounts of Pepsi. It&apos;s not something I am very proud of. I did it to be cool and to impress pretty girls &ndash; end of story.</p>

<p>Fast&ndash;forward to the Winter of 2007. It was mid afternoon and my throat was parched. At work, our boss keeps us well stocked with hydratious, tasty bevies, so I ventured into the back room to see what the old man had left for us in the ice chest. I smiled in anticipation. Would it be extra icy, bubbly, perhaps fermented? My toothy grin faded and I grimaced. Staring back at me was a Pepsi Cola, and his eleven brothers. Whatever possessed me to reach inside and grasp hold of the can, well your guess is as good as mine. Maybe, just maybe there was a tiny little fraction of desire for reconciliation. To be comrades and let bygones be bygones. Why continue this ridiculous quarrel, just put it behind us and move on. Maybe not. Either way it happened and then our eyes met. I hardly recognized it. Friendly, warm (metaphorically speaking, physically it was actually quite cold), Pepsi was smiling at me, inviting me to take a sip. A little hesitant at first, my hand shook as I pulled back the tab and pressed the chilled aluminum to my lips. But then I relaxed, this was easy! I literally drank in every moment. And just like that, it was gone.</p>

<p>Well, I still think that Pepsi tastes like something out of a humming bird feeder. Sorry, that&apos;s besides the point. The important thing is that we should all get along. If you are a Coke drinker, put back a Pepsi this Christmas season and spend a little QT with the other guy. Pepsies, nurse a Coca Cola Classic and spread some cheer. Besides, if you walk a mile in another cola drinkers shoes, you&apos;ll certainly not go thirsty</p>
