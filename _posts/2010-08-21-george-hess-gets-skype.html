<p>For immediate release: George Hess, a long time cell phone user, made a game changing decision last month when he signed up for Skype &ndash; a web based communication tool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since the Feds broke up Ma Bell it&apos;s been one problem after another&rdquo;, said the new voice over internal protocol user. Though the biggest determining factor in Mr. Hess&apos;s choice was not customer service, but bar count. &ldquo;Their (mobile plan provider&apos;s) commercials make it sound like you&apos;ll have more bars everywhere, and at my house I&apos;ve got none!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thanks to Skype, he is able to receive calls just as long as he is connected to the internet, and sitting at his computer, and logged into Skype, and has a microphone available. The option to video chat is one superiority that Skype has over his mobile phone. But not everyone George talks to is comfortable with it. &ldquo;I work from home, and a lot of times people will plug me into board meetings and pull me up on video chat, but I&apos;m still in my pj&apos;s or sitting on the pot you know? Some people just get weirded out by that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the time being, George Hess still plans on keeping his mobile number active. He welcomes fellow Skype account holders and friends to contact him online.</p>
