				<p>We began our Wednesday much like any other, running late. I could tell that I wasn&apos;t going to make the bus. And since I was already going to miss it, I poured myself another glass of orange juice.</p>
				<p>My wife screamed.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Must be a spider in the bathroom&rdquo;, I thought to myself. I kept pouring.</p>
				<p>My wife screamed again, a bit higher this time. &ldquo;Uh&ndash;oh, the toilet might be overflowing.&rdquo; I put the OJ down.</p>
				<p>Again my wife screamed higher. &ldquo;Oh crap! There&apos;s a serial killer in there!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I prepared myself for the worst and charged towards the bathroom just as she burst out and slammed the door. Relieved not to find any blood stains, and yet slightly annoyed, I thought about lecturing her on abusing the serial&ndash;killer&ndash;octave&ndash;scream. Then she began.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;THERE IS A&hellip;&rdquo; my inner dialog finished the sentence for her. Its version had something to do with a big spider. She informed me otherwise, &ldquo;&hellip;SQUIRREL IN OUR TOLIET!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;YES!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;SQUIRREL?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;YES!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;IN TOLIET?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;YES! I flushed and a SQUIRREL CAME OUT!!!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We had to think quickly and got the idea to open the bathroom window (from the outside) so as to encourage him to scurry back into the great outdoors. When I opened the front door I was greeted by another one of our forestry friends &ndash; a buck. He was standing on the doormat with his head slightly lowered and tilted toward the house. He was eavesdropping! What, were we on the set of Rocky and Bullwinkle? I half expected him to pipe up and say,</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Uh&hellip; you guys haven&apos;t seen a squirrel around here have you?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>My patience for nature was quickly reaching its limits and I yelled at the buck to getouttahere. He stalked away and I popped the screen off of the bathroom window. But the little guy was stuck in the bowl because he couldn&apos;t get around the lip of the toilet seat, (men, this is probably the manliest reason you&apos;ll ever be given for putting the toilet seat down &ndash; it&apos;s good for trapping small game). I knew I had to go in and rescue him.</p>
				<p>There was just one problem. What kind of squirrel winds up in your toilet anyway? The crazy rabies kind. I kept picturing the squirrel, flying out of the toilet and with a banshee like shriek, latching onto my face. But time was of the essence and in a mere two minutes my wife had me suited up in our most rabid&ndash;proof clothing: denim, a hoodie, and two layers of gloves (wool on the outside, rubber on the inside). With my hood synched tightly I entered into the lion&apos;s den.</p>
				<p>At this point, the squirrel was exhausted and laying half in the water and half along the &ldquo;shore&rdquo;. I tried to gingerly pick him up but that prompted him to attempt one last escape. This time his route took him underwater and back down the drain.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh no you don&apos;t!&rdquo; I said as I grabbed him by the tail. After a minor scuffle I found myself outside and standing over a waterlogged squirrel. He wasn&apos;t moving. Now I&apos;m not sure if it was my Disney saturated childhood or just plain old compassion for all creatures smaller than myself, but something compelled me to revitalize him. I took my thumbs and began CPR. When a few squirrel&ndash;sized gulps of water came out of his mouth I looked up and saw my wife cheering from the window. When I looked back down however, he still wasn&apos;t moving.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Maybe he needs mouth to mouth?&rdquo; I thought to myself. Self, not being quite as sympathetic as I, quickly shot that one down. &ldquo;He&apos;s dead you idiot. Burry the poor beast!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The funeral procession consisted of a short walk down the side of the house and dumping his plastic bag of a coffin into the garbage can. It hardly seemed adequate given this morning&apos;s events. I came back inside and discarded my gloves. As I raised a hard earned glass of orange juice to my lips, I knew one thing for sure; this squirrel would not soon be forgotten.</p>
