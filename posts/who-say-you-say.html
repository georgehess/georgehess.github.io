				<p>How could a song that rose to number three on the iTunes Singer
					Songwriter Charts and a YouTube video with over 100,000 hits
					just go away? Or more puzzling, why? That was the question I
					kept whisper&ndash;screaming (so as not to wake the family) while
					every search result produced either dormant, revoked, or
					completely irrelevant links. As the hours wained I began
					questioning something else, my sanity. I slammed the laptop shut
					(again, quietly) and resigned in frustration. I lay in bed, the
					day&apos;s events replaying in my head to a soundtrack stuck on
					repeat.</p>
				<p>Not but 12 hours earlier I was blissfully unaware of the single,
					&ldquo;You Say&rdquo; by George Morgan. Going about my day as though it were
					any other, listening to Pandora&apos;s desperate attempt to curate a
					playlist worthy of such eclectic tastes as my own. Then it just
					happened. Their algorithm struck paydirt! Something I like to
					call the Pandoradox Effect. I began thumbing up (that&apos;s a good
					thing) every track that came through. Joyfully discovering new
					songs and reading bios of artists I&apos;d never even heard of. I
					felt so alive! As I was in the midst of living my best life now,
					a very catchy, appropriately timed song began to play. And if
					you guessed <em>You Say</em> then <em>you right</em>. Like many of the other songs
					that afternoon, I immediately clicked over to the artist page to
					learn more. This was the moment in which I unwittingly opened
					the other Pandora&apos;s box.</p>
				<p>This is his only song? Oh he died in â€˜75. Cut down too soon.
					Tragic. Wait 1975? Then when was this released? There&apos;s no way
					this song is that old. Whose voice is this?</p>
				<p>One word: who. It was the catalyst that triggered a chain
					reaction of virtual clicks and technological tricks that would
					last nearly 48 hours before producing definitive answers. I&apos;ll
					spare you some of the monotony and try to sum up.</p>
				<h2>Misattribution</h2>
				<p>The few references to <em>You Say</em> that I could find were attributed
					to the genius of George T. Morgan, a very famous and very dead
					country artist&hellip; like Grand Ole Opry famous. Believe you me the
					Internet LOVES this guy. I&apos;m talking page after page of search
					results praising his contribution to country music. But <em>You
					Say&apos;s</em> singer had an unmistakable accent and not of the corn&ndash;fed
					variety. It sounded more like The Beatles English. I shifted my
					focus to the UK and stumbled across a tiny newspaper blurb. It
					mentioned that a young local man&apos;s first hit single was climbing
					the charts in 2013. His name &ndash; George (friggin&apos;) Morgan! His
					single &ndash; You (friggin&apos;) Say!</p>
				<p>So it really was written by a George Morgan. Just not the George
					Morgan. George H. Morgan to be precise. Or so his deleted
					Twitter account would lead me to believe. More on that later.
					But the middle initial was not enough to supplant Country King
					George from hogging the online spotlight.</p>
				<h2>YouTube Royalty</h2>
				<p>Armed with this intel, however, I was able to find an insightful
					blog post. It mentioned that our boy George&apos;s first song was
					made popular via a music video filmed by none other than YouTube
					sensation Sawyer Hartman. It had gone viral thanks to a little
					influencing by the social media duo Jackson and Finn Harries. I
					located said influential posts but found every link, retweet,
					and pin pointed to an unavailable video. Twitter posts often
					included @GeorgeHMorganMusic mentions but the account has since
					been deleted.</p>
				<h2>Listening to music by the beach</h2>
				<p>There was a side comment about a moniker that George Morgan goes
					by, The Beach. Now, if you&apos;ve ever Googled for music by The
					Beach then you know how you&apos;ll get everything from surfing to
					cake and nothing by George Morgan. iTunes and Spotify were a
					little more forgiving and I found his discography. It&apos;s great
					stuff too! But not a peep about the very song that started it
					all.</p>
				<p>I was starting to think that The Beach was yet a third George WTF
					Morgan but I found a setlist from one of his shows and it
					included <em>You Say</em>. Then I beheld, in all its glory, some shoddy
					cell phone footage of a live performance of <em>You Say</em> by The
					Beach. And there we have it: George Morgan is The Beach and he
					sang <em>You Say</em>!</p>
				<h2>Dead Ringer</h2>
				<p>So where did the official video go? Same for the song? Finn
					Harries posted an iTunes link years ago but like every other
					reference to <em>You Say</em>, it was dormant. The truly puzzling thing
					was not that it had been taken down, but why no one was missing
					it? What&hellip; if you see it do you die or something? I decided to
					go full&ndash;blown The Ring and track down the video no matter the
					cost.</p>
				<p>Using some Internet prowess, and free time that should have been
					directed elsewhere, I combed through lines of source code until
					I acquired the URL of the original video stream which is
					different than the actual YouTube page. Meh, Tomato&ndash;Tamato,
					what&apos;s the difference? I didn&apos;t bother getting my hopes up. I
					half heartedly pasted the URL into my browser&apos;s address bar and
					it burst into life with song and dance (well I was mostly doing
					the dancing). The original music video streamed across my very
					eyes in its entirety, and I lived to tell about it.</p>
				<p>My first thought was to continue <em>Ring</em>&ndash;ing it and follow in the
					footsteps of Naomi Watts. SPOILER ALERT. I would free the artist
					formerly know as George H. Morgan by releasing his forgotten
					video to the masses. Although I couldn&apos;t help but feel a little
					guilty. Did The Beach want it buried? Maybe he grew tired of it.
					Maybe he hates it! Or worse, maybe it&apos;s wrapped up in a lawsuit
					and I was about to entangle myself in a World Wide Web of
					international copyright infringement. I slowed my roll and
					contacted the top five people I believed to be responsible, if
					partially, for the success of <em>You Say</em>.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>George Morgan/The Beach (Talent)</li>
					<li>Max Honsinger (Audio Producer)</li>
					<li>Sawyer Hartman (Film Director)</li>
					<li>Jackson Harries (Promotion)</li>
					<li>James Byfield (Manager)</li>
				</ol>
				<p>I have reached out to them but to no avail. I am arguably nobody
					in their world but a fan and fellow George. I hope that they
					will re&ndash;release the song someday so that everyone can experience
					<em>You Say</em> as it was originally conceived.</p>
				<p>For now, I&apos;m content to write about it and patiently wait for the
					tide to wash this treasure back up on the beach&hellip; or maybe it&apos;s
					just gone, you say.</p>
