						<p class="story-intro">For my brother and I, 1998 would bring about the end of an era, our own Wonder Years. We would soon be adults and life would put its proverbial pedal to the floor, blowing through a decade like a fifth grade summer break. In that final year, we shed the last of our childish layers searching for an old abandoned mining town appropriately named &ldquo;Wonder&rdquo;.</p>

						<p class="story-intro">A long time ago I attended an evening course covering Mass Communications. Yawn right? I know. What I discovered was that some of life’s greatest lessons were not waiting for me inside a classroom… but from behind the wheel of a gently used 1993 Ford Escort.</p>

						<p class="story-intro">I have struggled for the longest time to understand why so many women compare themselves to the air&ndash;brushed covergirls that grace our checkout lines and newsstands. To me, it would be like comparing apples to wax oranges. Does&ndash;not&ndash;compute. One is real, one is fake. One tastes nice to kiss, the other like newsprint&hellip; not like I ever tried kissing the Cameron Diaz 1996 edition of Rolling Stone&hellip; wouldn&apos;t know anything about that.</p>
